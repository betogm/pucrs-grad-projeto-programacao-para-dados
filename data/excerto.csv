The game simulates the motivations, loyalties and desires of everyone in the country. As president or prime minister, it's your job to balance the need for income from taxes against the demands of the voters. Do you want your country to be an eco-friendly green paradise? Or a capitalist utopia? Will you pander to the patriots, the liberals or the religious pressure groups? Can you keep crime under control without destroying the civil liberties of your citizens? And can you keep good diplomatic relations with other nation states? Despite the complex simulation underneath, Democracy 2 is easy to pick up. An innovative user-interface shows the relationships between everything in the game just by hovering your mouse over an object. The game is 'turn based', so it's the ideal game for those who prefer an intelligent, thoughtful game. The key to the game are the policy 'sliders' that let you adjust how your government runs. You can raise or lower taxes with a slider, or even adjust education policy, or workers rights in exactly the same way. This system makes for a game that is easy to learn and difficult to master. Democracy 2 covers the whole range of political opinion and policy, from debates over stem cell research and school prayer, through the provision of state health care and benefit payments to the unemployed, right across to tax shelters for the wealthy, the death penalty, military spending and civil rights. Regardless of where you stand on political topics, you will have the option to take control of the government and put your ideology to the test.","['English']","['English']","‚ÄúAdjusting and balancing policies is what makes Democracy 2 tick, and it‚Äôs astoundingly compulsive‚Äù 4/5 ‚Äì GamesRadar ‚ÄúI cannot emphasize enough how addictive this game is‚Äù ‚Äì GamingShogun ‚Äú If you‚Äôve been looking for a superb abstraction of political operations, then Democracy 2 is definitely a game you should look at.‚Äù 6/8 ‚Äì OutOf8","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218040/header.jpg?t=1447356388","www.positech.co.uk/democracy2","http://www.positech.co.uk/democracy2/support.html","support@positech.co.uk",True,True,False,0,"",0,56,50,"",0,0,"",9,0,9,0,"Positech Games","Positech Games","Single-player","Indie,Simulation,Strategy","Political Sim,Simulation,Strategy,Indie,Politics,Turn-Based","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218040/ss_36809c316f3a2c90e1fb904b5aee4713d98dba01.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356388,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218040/ss_7894a932a77d232811c568b2814f4af2e6a311f7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356388,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218040/ss_1a46888a8d1ec3b45fcece867e477092c609792a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356388,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218040/ss_561589e99b43620fefdf5ce11e24ace588239dc1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356388,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218040/ss_76d0e5518a6505659f15356f6b7c759edff573c4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356388,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218040/ss_a5b28f9c0fbb898c750f09b97981848d9ba400be.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356388,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218040/ss_6461a2ccfcb0388fa3bd715f014ba737dd07f347.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356388,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218040/ss_2f72bebda4b0bc6a62687a07b6f9763e42145d70.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356388","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/82049/movie_max.mp4?t=1447356687"

288100,"MechRunner","Jul 15, 2016","0 - 20000",0,0,6.99,0,"MechRunner is an endless action game that casts you as a powerful mech in stunning cinematic battles against a relentless robotic army. Game Story On June 30th, 1908 a mysterious explosion took place over the Tunguska River in Siberia, Russia that wiped out trees and wildlife for over 800 square miles. To this day it remains the largest ‚Äúimpact event‚Äù in our planet‚Äôs recorded history. In the years that followed, dozens of scientific expeditions to the site attempted to explain the disaster but failed to come to any conclusions. In the mid-1940s however, a team of scientists from the Russian secret service visiting the site stumbled upon the wreckage of an alien spacecraft containing technology that far exceeded our own. In the years that followed, the KGB set to work harnessing this mysterious new power source and created a new secret weapons program - The Division of Advanced Weaponry or 'O.S.O.' They thought they could control the new power they‚Äôd discovered, but it began to do more than run their machines. It began to drive the men working on it mad. The man in charge of the O.S.O., General Yuri Petrakoff, seemed particularly affected and on April 14th, 1949, Petrakoff launched a full scale assault on Europe. One of Petrakoff‚Äôs lead engineers, Jesper Teterev, went AWOL and left the program early, wary of what was happening there. He went to live in secret with his sister, Isabel and niece, Allison. While in hiding however, Jesper (with the help of budding engineer and pilot Allison) was busy building his own mechanized war machine, called the XP-41, certain it may be needed one day to stave off the O.S.O.'s evil creations. He was right. Gameplay MechRunner is an endless-style action game mixed with fast and furious mode-changing mech action! It is a 'runner' in that the player is constantly moving forward while tracking down lethal O.S.O. forces but what makes it special is that you‚Äôre piloting a giant robot capable of some serious destruction! Other endless runners feature action elements, but none like this. Heat seeking missiles, heavy caliber bullets, laser cannons, and concussion bombs meet destructible buildings, debris littered streets, and tons of slice-able enemies to create a fast paced, visually stunning experience! A typical game may take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to play. The higher your skill, the longer the game, the more rewards you will collect, and the more content you will unlock! Features Meticulously detailed, fast-paced action Switch between Tank and Robot modes on the fly Slice &amp; Dice disabled enemies in cinematic fashion!

At the beginning of the game the hiding team is given a certain amount of time to hide. During this time, the searching team waits outside. When the time expires, the doors open and you can search. The hiding team can transform into various objects and has great movement speed. To make it harder to find the player after turning into an object, there are various dynamic objects scattered on the map that change their position each time the map is loaded. The search team runs slowly and has a narrow line of sight. They cannot see through objects, unlike the other team. They have a special flashlight with which they can search for other players. Both teams have a double jump. In addition, there are mini-games on the map, for example, while the team that will be searching is waiting for the other team while they are hiding, you can play soccer.

1997130,"Paze Knight Ellen and the Dungeon town Sodom","Apr 7, 2023","0 - 20000",0,0,15.99,1,"‚ñ†‚ñ†A 'Female Knight RPG' featuring a knight who keeps getting herself into naughty situations‚ñ†‚ñ† Blonde, dignified, and strong. Don't you wanna just corner her and humiliate her? -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Paze Kingdom Knight Ellen was heading towards a dungeon town called 'Sodom'. There were reports of 'Goblins' attacking the residents there. Ellen was there to scout out the place. Lilia, a wizard in training, tagged along with her. 'I can see the town, it's over that hill' Ellen and Lilia whipped the horse and raced towards the hill. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ‚ñ†‚ñ†Characters‚ñ†‚ñ† [Ellen] (CV ÊüöÊú®„Å§„Å∞„ÇÅ) A female knight from the Paze Kingdom Knights. Also known as the Paze Ritter. She was a dignified knight who fought hard to help those in need. She was a symbol of 'Power' and 'Justice'. But her luck ran out as soon as she got here... She was forced to strip naked and ended up becoming a prostitute. But she kept at it. She kept on fighting against the odds... [Lilia] (CV Â∞èÊó•Âêë„Çâ„ÇÄ„Å≠) Wizard in training. Lilia adored Ellen like an older sister. She was always trying to help Ellen with 'Intel'. She was innocent and didn't have a body like Ellen's but she ended up just like her... She was the perfect 'Bait'. Ellen was extremely strong, but once the enemy took Lilia hostage, there wasn't much she could do. Lilia was Ellen's biggest weakness. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ‚ñ†‚ñ†Basic gameplay‚ñ†‚ñ† [Butt-naked by default] Sodom, a town covered in walls. Residents aren't allowed to wear clothes to prevent anyone from smuggling out goods. Adventurers and Knights were allowed to wear gear on their upper body, and the rule applied to Kingdom Knights as well. Ellen tried to fight it but she had no choice in order to proceed with her mission. She was uncomfortable at first, but she was starting to get used to this. [Regular short RPG] Ellen was more than strong enough to clear out the dungeon by herself. But since she wasn't fully geared, she was always at risk of being assaulted by other adventurers, monsters, and allies. Solo-battle for the most part, but the party can grow up to 4 when Lilia and Sodom soldiers join in. [Story revolves around the main town] Use the 'Town' as base camp when exploring the dungeon. In town you can find facilities like shops, hotels, brothels, slums, public bath, recollection room, and more. Basic game cycle: Go into the dungeon, get treasure, improve gear, go back into the dungeon and take out the boss, and report to the master. ‚ñ†‚ñ†Adult system‚ñ†‚ñ† [Adult event] Regular event adult scene. Some adult scenes and pictures are animated. Most events can be evaded if you choose to. You can stay a virgin until you beat the game. You can watch past events from the recollection room in town. You can recreate the event or simply watch the CG. Once you beat the game, it will all be unlocked. [3 types of naughty combat] (1) Typical naughty combat where you get attacked my monsters. You should also watch out for other adventurers. Ellen and Lilia are both vulnerable. (2) The men in your party will assault you two if their TP increases to a certain level. (3) During brothel dungeon events, Ellen works as a prostitute and takes out enemies using 'Sex moves'. ‚ñ†‚ñ†Game concept‚ñ†‚ñ† -Love for brave blonde submissive female knights -Love for elegant pink hair -Love for bikini armor and naughty armor -Get raped by delinquents for no reason -Short RPG with combat -Beat the game a virgin -Get raped/rape during combat -Get raped by members of your party -Look at all kinds of naughty status ‚ñ†‚ñ†Event situation samples‚ñ†‚ñ† -Strip naked -Raped in public -Raped after losing to a dungeon boss (combat can be skipped) -Nice hotel owner, room that can't be locked, public shower -Lilia staying home alone is in danger... -Bathing with men -Paying off soldiers with your body -A delinquent joins your party and bonds with you at the hotel -Collecting cum to become a prostitute -Can't disobey, they took Lilia hostage... -Help the young villagers become men ...And more... Lots of gang-bang scenes... ‚ñ†‚ñ†Game features‚ñ†‚ñ† -Beat the game as a virgin: Possible (Ellen and Lilia both) -Recollection event: 30~ -Time to beat the game: 4, 5 hours -Difficulty: Easy and Normal ‚ñ†‚ñ†Safe design -4, 5 hours to beat. -If there's a naughty scene after losing to a boss, you can choose to lose the fight. You can also use self-destruct items. -All recollection scenes will be unlocked once you beat the game. Hints available in easy mode. -You can turn the voice ON/OFF, and SHOW/HIDE male characters. -Symbol Encounter","['Japanese', 'English', 'Simplified Chinese']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/header.jpg?t=1680851455","","","info@wasabi.sub.jp",True,False,False,0,"",0,0,0,"",0,0,"This game contains the following sexual content „ÉªStrong language „ÉªSexual language",0,0,0,0,"dHRÁ†î","WASABI entertainment","Single-player","Action,Indie,RPG","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_b5e83ea293064fffffedc48e90d852b635c0cf09.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_f7db0ef1ab43a68ffdd89b76ec84bcd33bd2cdff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_d5660696efd50f210df3024e715e478affa31c95.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_bc0d808cbb05bfaa68df98b6e46f963bb3ecd6c1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_938208b5f5c2ab13dac6e359e7bcfa97d794fa66.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_4a4b649057461f51084d2102afc056642c92e0fe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_a69d213962be45f774eabddd3e6e93ead04d010b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_6b927a0c8aaae9f5d222479cdfea7351053f8701.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_ec7b6e1902c0644609afa18777994c656a007645.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_4529942d8d4f8afd4c4d5f4a82e5b8e8ce662e13.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_d68fc831bdbc51fd15582aede678ac70ea1c1735.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_f3fd564dc493540191ef335c4a4db65f363f639c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_de1307616c11f31045ca452aa8cb889762bf82dc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_ea6b4df6fe9ab30896c85700596f4e16e849b40a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_e7196733855189335ec296cb12c2fc3613de5492.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_3f2a5d6cb23c417f99437b45e8ddebc5c2268b7c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1997130/ss_79767729d0bf2acfe84ea1683db6d16fbbb27649.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680851455","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256936852/movie_max.mp4?t=1679415877"
